# Software-Test-Automation
Project form my Software Testing Class


How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Through my testiing using Junit automation I was able to have the program run over 95% coverage and passing all the tests I put it through. 
This shows that my code is both functional and secure.


How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

When listening for user needs I take tabs on what they want and think of solutions. If I can do ask questions if I run into something I am unsure of. I think 
of ways to make things work as soon as I hear the requirements. When designing the program I end up doing requirement planning first and then build the rest of the
program around it. This way the requirements are met and everything works to make the requirments better.


How do I approch designing software?

With both video games and general software as soon as I hear a requirement I am thinking about what I can do to achieve it. Looking at a list of the requirements 
when in the designing phase I will put those as the starting points for designing. Building around the requirements means the program will hit each requirements 
and the requirements will be complimented by the rest of the program.
